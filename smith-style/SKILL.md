# File Naming & Path Standards

**Load if:** Git operations, PR workflows, new project setup
**Prerequisites:** @smith-principles/SKILL.md

## CRITICAL: Naming Separators

**Underscore (_)**: Multi-word phrases as single concept
- `user_authentication`, `query_processor`, `semantic_search`
- Think: "What kind of X?" → underscore

**Hyphen (-)**: Hierarchical/parallel relationships
- `auth-login` (login is part of auth)
- `api-rest` vs `api-graphql` (variants)
- Dates: `2025-01-15`
- Tickets: `JIRA-1234`

## File Patterns

**Test files**: `test_«module»_«function»_«type».py`
**JSON test data**: `«module»_«function»_cases.json`
**Documentation**: `«topic».md` (hyphen for hierarchy, underscore for phrases)
**Config**: `.env`, `pyproject.toml`, `AGENTS.md`

## Path References

**Use code blocks, not Markdown links:**
```markdown
**Core Principles**: @smith-principles/SKILL.md - Description
**Related Skill**: @skill-name/SKILL.md - Description
```

**Variables**: `$WORKSPACE_ROOT`, `$REPO_ROOT`, `$HOME`

## Conventional Commits

**Format**: `type: description` or `type(scope): description`

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, test, chore, perf, build, ci

**Length limits (50/72 rule):**
- Subject: 50 chars target, 72 max
- Body: 72 chars per line

### Examples

```text
feat(auth): add token refresh
fix: resolve CORS issues
docs: update deployment guide
```

**Also keep in mind:**
- Scope each commit to a single logical change — avoid mixing unrelated
  changes ("add X and fix Y")
- Use `docs` only when the commit doesn't also change code

**Special prefixes** (outside conventional commits):
- `#WIP` — Work-in-progress checkpoint, not a conventional commit (used by auto-commit rules)

## Branch Names

**Patterns** (in order of frequency in this repo):

1. **Compound** (most common): `type/«hierarchical-scope»_«single-concept-description»`
   - Hyphens preserve the hierarchical scope (matches the commit scope).
   - A single `_` separates scope from description.
   - Underscores inside the description treat the whole phrase as one concept.

2. **Description-only**: `type/«single-concept-description»` — when there's no
   meaningful hierarchical scope, just underscored words.

3. **Scope-only-hierarchy**: `type/«hierarchical-scope»-«sub-hierarchy»` — when
   the whole name is hierarchy (e.g. `smith-tools-ext`).

**Real examples from merged PRs:**
- `fix/plan-claude_model_detection_improvements` (scope: plan→claude; desc: "model detection improvements" → all underscores)
- `fix/plan-claude-review_polish` (scope: plan→claude→review; desc: "polish")
- `docs/gh-pr-attribution_wording` (scope: gh→pr; desc: "attribution wording")
- `fix/smith_convention_renames` (no hierarchy; desc only: "smith convention renames")
- `feat/smith-ctx-claude-ext` (all hierarchy: smith→ctx→claude→ext, no description)
- `feat/smith-automation_skill` (scope: smith→automation; desc: "skill")

Branch type MUST match commit type. Prefer full words over abbreviations
(`cmd`, `cfg`, `auth`) unless the full word exceeds 15 chars OR the
abbreviation is a domain-standard term in this repo (`gh` = GitHub,
`pr` = pull request, `ci` = continuous integration, `mcp` = Model Context
Protocol). `command`, `configuration`, `authentication` all fit — spell
them out.

### Avoid

- `feat/user-authentication` — multi-word single concept; should be `feat/user_authentication`
- `feat/auth_login` — hierarchy (login is part of auth); should be `feat/auth-login`
- `feat/ctx-claude-slash-cmd-rule` — three errors in one: (a) `slash-cmd` should be `slash_command` (multi-word single concept); (b) `cmd` is an unnecessary abbreviation; (c) the separator between scope `ctx-claude` and description should be `_`, not `-`. Correct: `feat/ctx-claude_slash_command_rule`.
- `fix/auth_post_review` / `fix/auth_after_review` — names the change's ORIGIN (a review round), not the change. Name what it does: `fix/auth_token_expiry`. Never put `post_review`/`post-review`/`after_review` in a branch or commit.

**Pre-push checklist (use this before every `git push`):**

1. Read the branch name out loud.
2. For each `-` and `_` in the name, justify it:
   - `-` ← "this is hierarchy or a parallel variant"
   - `_` ← "this is a multi-word single concept" OR "this separates the scope from the description"
3. If any separator can't be justified — the name is wrong; rename before push.
4. If the branch name contains an abbreviation, ask: "is the full word ≤15 chars AND not a domain-standard term (`gh`, `pr`, `ci`, `mcp`)? If yes, use the full word."
5. If the name was not explicitly given by the user, confirm it with them before
   the first push — don't ship a name you invented without a chance to correct it.

This checklist is a blocking gate, not advisory — run it before every first push
(referenced from `@smith-gh-pr` Pre-PR checklist). It exists because the same underscore-vs-hyphen mistake has recurred
across multiple PRs (#71/#72 skill names, #80 branch name) — both rounds
required follow-up fixes. The rule itself was always documented; the failure
mode was not pausing to apply it before pushing.

## External Communication Standards

**Language matching:**
- Match the language of the source context
  (English PR → English reply; zh-Hant Notion → zh-Hant reply)
- Code artifacts always English: variable names, commits, branch names, inline code comments
- Default for user-facing explanations when context is ambiguous: zh-Hant (user preference)
- Never switch language unprompted — if unsure, ask once

**Slack formatting (mrkdwn, not Markdown):**
- Links: `<https://url|display text>` (not `[text](url)`)
- Emphasis: `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `` `code` ``
- Mentions: `<@USERID>` format, never display names
- Thread replies for follow-ups; avoid walls of text in channels

**Wiki-link leakage prevention:**
- `[[Page Title]]` renders as broken literal text outside Notion
- When copying to Slack/GitHub/Jira: convert to plain name or full URL

**Issue format (Job Story):**
- "When «situation», I want to «motivation», so I can «expected outcome»"
- Describe the problem and outcome, not the implementation approach

## Before You Finish

**Before naming:**
1. Is it a single concept? → underscore
2. Is it a part/variant? → hyphen
3. Is it a date/ticket? → hyphen

**Before committing:**
1. Subject ≤72 chars?
2. Single atomic change?
3. Type matches branch?
