- **Load if**: Always active (foundation for all development)
- **Prerequisites**: None (foundation document)
- **Referenced by**: All rules*.md files, all AGENTS.md files

## Fundamental Principles

<required>

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): Single source of truth; eliminate duplication
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplest solution that works; avoid unnecessary complexity
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't implement until actually needed
- **SINE** (Simple Is Not Easy): Simplicity requires deliberate effort; refactor toward simplicity
- **MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive): Categories don't overlap; coverage is complete
- **Occam's Razor**: Prefer solutions with fewest assumptions
